</p>

Create a Three.js proyect with this boilerplate. This starter includes Webpack development server and all the fundamental modules you might need to create your animations.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Clone this repository**
   
      Use git to clone the repository.

      ```shell
      # this command will create a new folder named your-proyect-name
      git clone https://github.com/jofreemanuel/threejs-starter your-proyect-name
      ```

1.  **Install packages**
   
      Navigate to your new proyect directory and use npm package manager to install packages.

      ```shell
      cd your-proyect-name
      npm install
      ```

1.  **Start developing**
   
      Start webpack live server.

      ```shell
      npm run dev
      ```
      Your site is now running. Check your terminal output to know the url to access your site. It might look something similar to `http://192.168.0.198:8080/`

1.  **Open the source code and start editing**
   
      Open your-proyect-name directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/script.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
